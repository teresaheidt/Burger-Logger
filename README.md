## What:
This is a Burger logger restaurant app, deployed using Heroku!

## How:
* This restaurant app, Eat-Da-Burger!, lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Techologies used:
MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM üç¨
